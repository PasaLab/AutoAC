## Dataset
We use datasets recently proposed by [HGB](https://www.biendata.xyz/hgb/).ACM can be found in this repo,DBLP and IMDB can be found  in [HGB](https://www.biendata.xyz/hgb/#/datasets) 

## Quick start
The requirements of the running environment is listed in requirements.txt.After installing the packages run: 
```
bash test_result.sh
```
## How to evaluate
After running AutoAc,five submit files will be generated.You can upload them in [this website](https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/hgb-1/) to get results
